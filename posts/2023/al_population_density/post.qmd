This map shows a unique population density map of Albania using [Kontur](https://www.kontur.io/geospatial-datasets-catalog/) population data as of November, 2023, and the [`rayshader`](https://www.rayshader.com/) R package by Tyler Morgan-Wall. According to the data, the cities containing the densest areas are Fier (11577), Tiranë (10856), and Korçë (8604).

This project was created based on the latest Kontur population data (November, 2023) and shapefiles for the country. The data was combined, transformed and visualized in R Studio with text overlaying in Adobe Illustrator. The code and other necessary information can be found on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/gentiang/population_density). I take huge inspiration from [Spencer Schien](https://github.com/Pecners) whose maps and code are a massive help.
