        "In this project, I analyze hotel booking data between the years 2018--2020 acquired from [Absent Data](https://absentdata.com/hotel_revenue_historical_full/) to figure out the revenue breakdown for several kinds of hotel characteristics. The data is analyzed in SQL (Microsoft SQL Server, and simultaneously in Google's BigQuery) and visualized in Power BI via an interactive dashboard.\n",
        "\n",
        "The revenue data was split between several sheets in an Excel Workbook that had to be imported to Microsoft SQL Server, appended and summarized. Further on, indicators such as yearly revenue, yearly revenue by hotel type and the latter's percentage in the yearly revenue were created. The data is then broken down by hotel type, year, and market segment. Below you can see a snapshot of the data along with the SQL code.\n",
        "\n",
        "The data clearly shows that yearly revenue is increasing in its first year. However, it soon drops off in 2020. Nevertheless, one caveat is that data for 2020 may not be complete and therefore not show the true change in revenue. As it pertains to revenue by hotel type, the data shows a mixed result in that resort hotels brought more revenue in 2018 than city hotels, but failed to do so in the subsequent years.\n",
