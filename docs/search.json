    "title": "A Quick Look at Inflation in Kosovo",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Two years ago, with tens of thousands of people out of work and politicians striving to lift the economies in the Western Balkans out of a pandemic-induced recession, inflation was inevitable. Moreover, with the beginning of the Russian invasion in Ukraine that has disrupted supply chains considerably, inflation has been affected doubly so. Though transitory in nature as a consequence of dysfunctional supply chains and labor shortages that would be expected to return back to normal as demonstrated by previous economic recessions, current inflation is running particularly high.\nAccording to the latest data from National Statistical Offices in the Western Balkans, the annual inflation rate in June, 2022 was reaching 15%, similar to that during the global recession of 2008, as measured by the harmonized index of consumer prices. North Macedonia leads the pack with a rate of 14.5%, closely followed by Kosovo (14.1%). Montenegro and Serbia have experienced a considerable increase in their inflation by 11.9% and 11.6%, respectively. Albania’s inflation in June, 2022 stood at 6.6%, considerably less compared to the other countries.\nOne of the countries where inflation has risen fastest over the past couple of months is Kosovo. In June, 2021, the annual inflation rate was standing at 2.4%, picking up gradually every month and becoming 14.1% in June, 2022. Being that Kosovo is a net importer of electricity, oil, wheat, corn, vegetable oil, supply shocks to international markets as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine are bound to be reflected in its economy1.\nRegardless of the absolute level of inflation in Kosovo, what’s most striking is the relatively fast rise of inflation in the year 2022. The annual change in Kosovo’s monthly inflation in the second quarter of this year averaged 13.6% compared to the second quarter of 2021, when monthly inflation averaged just 2.6%. High inflation has been an exception in the past 20 years in Kosovo, where inflation exceeded the 5% bound only twice before the current one. However, it seems that inflation in Kosovo is slowly approaching the 15% bound as well. While high inflation is a transitory period, current levels of inflation in Kosovo stand at an all-time high and it is unforeseeable as to when they will drop.\nThe visualizations and analysis in this article were done in RStudio, and the source code, raw datasets, and additional files for the analysis can be found on my GitHub page.2,3,4,5,6,7"

    "title": "An Overview of Kosovo’s Trade",
    "section": "",
    "text": "An overview of trade data collected from the Comext data portal managed by the European Comission that houses detailed trade data for Western Balkan countries shows unusual recent developments in terms of trade volume, trade partners and types of products traded.\nBetween the years 2010 and 2021, imports rose gradually as well as exports, which did so at a slower pace. However, in 2021 the negative trade balance deepened quickly and considerably, reaching €-4 billion in 2021, with exports standing at €593 million and imports at €4.6 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nYearly trade in Kosovo comprising of exports, imports and trade balance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021, Kosovo’s main trading partners were the United States when it comes to exports, and Germany when it comes to imports, standing at €123 million and €607 million, respectively.\n\n\n\nKosovo’s main trading partners\n\n\nWhen looking at the different kinds of goods traded in 2021, we see that Kosovo’s main exports were miscellaneous manufactured articles, base metals and articles thereof, and plastics and articles thereof. On the other hand, Kosovo’s main imports comprise of mineral products, machinery and electrical equipment, and prepared foodstuffs and beverages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNevertheless, absolute trade volume does not necessarily explain where the unusual increases in both exports and imports come from. A quick look at the biggest differences in the value of goods traded between 2019 and 2021 illuminates the problem partially.\nWhen it comes to exports, we see that 2021 displayed a hefty increase of €134 million in miscellaneous manufactured articles (HS20 according to international tariff codes), specifically wooden furniture and sanitary products (not shown here).\n\n\n\nDifference in exports between 2021 and 2019\n\n\nIn terms of imports, Kosovo experienced a large increase of €164 million in machinery, appliances and electrical equipment (HS16), with wind-powered generating sets and data-processing equipment taking occupying the largest values (not shown here).\n\n\n\nDifference in imports between 2021 and 2019\n\n\nNevertheless, despite knowing what kinds of goods took the lead in terms of trade value, we cannot necessarily conclude with absolute certainty that Kosovo is trading more in quantity. Being that Kosovo is a net importer, it is generally subjected to global price changes and therefore may suffer as a result of global price instability like we have seen in recent years which can undoubtedly be reflected in the country’s trade volume. More research has to be done while considering inflation as well.\n\nThis project was carried out based on monthly trade data for Kosovo collected from the Comext database for trade data managed by Eurostat. The data was combined and cleaned in R Studio. The analysis and visualizations were also produced in R Studio, and the code and other necessary information can be found on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/gentiang/trade_analysis."
